# Philosophers

Description : 
This project is to create some THREADS and MUTEX for the first time. 

RULES :
You have to imagine a table with philosophers around, each one has a plate and a fork in front of him.
They can do three actions : EAT, SLEEP and THINK. To eat a philosopher needs two forks so he takes the fork of his neighbor on the right or on the left.
If one of the philosophers does not eat before a certain time he dies and the program stops.

Instruction for us :
